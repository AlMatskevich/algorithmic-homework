<h1>Homemade Pizza</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p><img src="pizza.png" alt="pizza" width="500" height="333"align="left"></p>
<p>• 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</p>
<p>• 1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p>• 1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</p>
<p>• 1/4 cup canola oil</p>
<p>• 1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>• 3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>• 1 small onion, chopped</p>
<p>• 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</p>
<p>• 3 teaspoons dried oregano</p>
<p>• 2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>1. In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms. </p>
<p>2. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain. </p>
<p>3. Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese. </p>
<p>4. Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</p>
